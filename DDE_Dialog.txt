sizes are mostly less than or equal to 20 μm for fpm dolomite, less than or equal to 50 μm for fpnm dolomite, and less than or equal to 100 μm for fd dolomite. the fpm dolomite decreases in abundance, and fpnm dolomite increases in abundance, with increasing grain content of the facies. the δ18o values of dolostones (although considered an obsolete term, dolostone is used here to mean rock containing ≥80% dolomite) indicate early dolomitization at low temperatures in permian seawater or evaporated seawater, with landward facies (mudstone and wackestone) generally dolomitized by more evaporated waters and seaward grainy facies generally dolomitized by less evaporated, more normal marine seawaters. stratigraphic variations in the dolostones’ δ18o values track with facies variations through fourth-order depositional sequences and indicate that different stratigraphic bodies of dolomite formed from seawaters with different degrees of evaporation. the δ13c values of the dolostones exhibit temporal trends inherited from the precursor limestones. variations in the lateral and vertical abundance of dolomite and dolomite fabrics, in the propensity for each facies to be dolomitized, and in the dolomites’ oxygen isotopic values all suggest that multiple dolomitization events occurred in the khuff-c reservoir as depositional cycles accumulated, with some dolostones overprinted by younger events. average porosities of grain-rich dolostones are greater than those of mud-rich dolostones, indicating that depositional facies preordained porosity distribution within the dolostones.

tectonic activity, they are difficult to distinguish from those produced by changes of climate or by local aggradation. this presentation deals with an alluvial fan depositional style that occurs in arid conditions in which rare, large-scale debris flows are modified by more frequent, but small-scale, stream floods. recognition of this type of deposition in an alluvial-fan succession could indicate change of climate and aggradational sequences may be seen by changes in its fabric.a small alluvial fan in saline valley, california, was described from apex to toe to determine the types of fabrics produced and their relative distributions. debris flows produce levees and lobes which appear as 1 to 3 m high mounds of poorly sorted, matrix-supported conglomerates. these mounds become lower, less regularly distributed downfan and disappear before the fan toe. the tops and outer edges of levees and lobes have the largest boulders, which are tightly packed in a near-vertical, imbricatelike pattern. fan-toe debris-flow fabric is 1 to 10-cm thick pebbly mud sheets with irregular lines of isolated cobbles. the small streams are deeply incised between levees at the fan apex, shallow and anastomosing around levees and lobes at mid-fan, and braided at the fan toe. deep channels are floored by step patterns produced by partly or completely exhumed debris-flow boidders wdth fine gravel or sand deposited on the upstream side. shallow channels have two major fabrics: (1) 5 to 20-cm high hummocks of poorly sorted, muddy gravel surroimded by fine gravel and sand with better sorting, and (2) muddy, moderately well-sorted gravel in which the long axes are horizontal and oriented parallel with flow. the braided channels at the fan toe are dominated by horizontally discontinuous lamination and abundant mud intraclasts. windblown sand commonly accumulates in channels, preserving mud curls and mud drapes from the last flood.all fabrics observed in the small fan in saline valley were also seen in larger fans there and in several other mojave basins. these fabrics were also found in some triassic alluvial-fan deposits in new jersey."], ["sedimentary fabrics of

cyclic rock sequence consisting mainly of three alternating rock types—siliciclastics, carbonates, and black shales rich in organic matter. of the two black-shale sequences in the basin, the upper is the devonian and mississippian shales, which have attracted interest as a source of uranium, oil and gas, and pyrolytic oil. recent geologic studies have defined their regional stratigraphy, distribution, and thickness. these studies have provided the necessary framework for resource evaluations and for geochemical characterizations, including analysis of the chemical structure of the kerogen by 13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr). an eastward-thickening sequence of predominantly magnetic resonance (nmr). an eastward-thickening sequence of predominantly very fine to fine-grained rocks contains an aggregate thickness of dark shale (rich in organic matter) that ranges from about 15 ft (4.6 m) or less in the southcentral part of the basin to about 500ft(150m) in the northeastern part of the basin. the average organic-carbon content for the black shales ranges from about 3% in the eastern part of the basin to about 10% in the western part. regionally, the maturation of the shales increases eastward. various studies suggest that the devonian and mississippian shales west of the allegheny front have not exceeded the catagenic stage. the 13c nmr determinations of aromaticity of kerogen from selected stratigraphic intervals suggest that a significant amount of the parent organic material was of terrestrial origin. this nmr work corroborates visual evidence such as the presence of coalified plant material and the known initial flourishing of vascular plants in devonian time. maturation of shale containing aromatic kerogen derived primarily from vascular plants generated mostly nonassociated “dry” natural gas. therefore, the composition of the gas in the black shales, whether “wet” or “dry,” appears to be more closely related to the kerogen type or degree of aromaticity than to the degree of thermal maturation. the devonian and mississippian black shales in the basin are estimated to contain 200-300 mmcf of gas. recoverable-reserve estimates are

pore-lining clay minerals, and the initial dissolution of detrital grains. authigenic quartz; pore-filling phyllosilicates; pore-filling, grain-replacive zeolites; albitized detrital plagioclase; authigenic k-feldspar; illite; and late calcite dominate burial diagenesis. the formation of iron oxides and dissolution of calcite cement resulted from tectonic uplift during the tertiary. albitization and zeolite formation during burial are among the most pronounced diagenetic processes that affected these sandstones.pore-filling clay minerals, calcite, and zeolites have substantially reduced sandstone porosity. however, appreciable primary porosity has been preserved by the formation of early clay coats and pore linings, which retarded further cementation. secondary porosity is present to varying degrees in the sandstones and is the result of dissolution of unstable framework grains. in the santai and adjacent areas of the southern junggar basin, the cangfanggou group sandstones can be moderate to good quality reservoirs (measured core porosity ranges from 12.9 to 23.7%, averaging 18.2%), whereas the xiaoquangou group sandstones in general have relatively poor reservoir quality. based on burial and thermal histories and diagenetic patterns, we predict that equivalent permian–triassic sandstone intervals in the enormous western part of the southern junggar

imv is frequently paired with additional strategies to improve weaning from ventilator support or to improve cardiovascular stability in patients who may need full life support.\nsynchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation is a variation of imv, in which the ventilator breaths are synchronized with patient inspiratory effort.  simv, with and without pressure support has not been shown to have any advantages over continuous mandatory ventilation (cmv) in terms of mortality  or weaning success,  and has been shown to result in longer weaning times when compared to t-piece trials or gradual reductions in pressure support. some studies have shown an increase in patient work of breathing when switched from cmv to simv, and others have demonstrated potential detrimental effects of simv on respiratory muscles and respiratory drive.\nmandatory minute ventilation is a mode which requires the operator to determine what the appropriate minute ventilation for the patient should be, and the ventilator then monitors the patient's ability to generate this volume every 7.5 seconds. if the calculation suggests the volume target will not be met, simv breaths are delivered at the targeted volume to achieve the desired minute ventilation.  allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient’s preset minimum minute volume requirement. if the patient maintains the minute volume settings for vt x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered. if the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  the method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (ve) is different per ventilator brand and model, but generally there is a window of time being monitored and a smaller window being checked against that larger window (i.e., in the dräger evita® line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured against to make a decision for if a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation).  mmv is the most optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long term complications related to mechanical ventilation.\nproportional assist ventilation is a mode in which the ventilator guarantees the percentage of work regardless of changes in pulmonary compliance and resistance. the ventilator varies the tidal volume and pressure based on the patients work of breathing, the amount it delivers is proportional to the percentage of assistance it is set to give.\nadaptive support ventilation is a positive pressure mode of mechanical ventilation that is closed-loop controlled. in this mode, the frequency and tidal volume of breaths of a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient’s requirements. the lung mechanics data are used to adjust the depth and rate of breaths to minimize the work rate of breathing. in the asv mode, every breath is synchronized with patient effort if such an effort exists, and otherwise, full mechanical ventilation is provided to the patient.\nasv is a patented technology originally described as one of the embodiments of us patent no. 4986268. in this invention, the control algorithm computes the optimal rate of respiration to minimize the work rate of breathing. the rationale is to make the patient's breathing pattern comfortable and natural within safe limits, and thereby

not sensed.  imv is frequently paired with additional strategies to improve weaning from ventilator support or to improve cardiovascular stability in patients who may need full life support.\nsynchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation is a variation of imv, in which the ventilator breaths are synchronized with patient inspiratory effort.  simv, with and without pressure support has not been shown to have any advantages over continuous mandatory ventilation (cmv) in terms of mortality  or weaning success,  and has been shown to result in longer weaning times when compared to t-piece trials or gradual reductions in pressure support. some studies have shown an increase in patient work of breathing when switched from cmv to simv, and others have demonstrated potential detrimental effects of simv on respiratory muscles and respiratory drive.\nmandatory minute ventilation is a mode which requires the operator to determine what the appropriate minute ventilation for the patient should be, and the ventilator then monitors the patient's ability to generate this volume every 7.5 seconds. if the calculation suggests the volume target will not be met, simv breaths are delivered at the targeted volume to achieve the desired minute ventilation.  allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient’s preset minimum minute volume requirement. if the patient maintains the minute volume settings for vt x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered. if the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  the method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (ve) is different per ventilator brand and model, but generally there is a window of time being monitored and a smaller window being checked against that larger window (i.e., in the dräger evita® line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured against to make a decision for if a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation).  mmv is the most optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long term complications related to mechanical ventilation.\nproportional assist ventilation is a mode in which the ventilator guarantees the percentage of work regardless of changes in pulmonary compliance and resistance. the ventilator varies the tidal volume and pressure based on the patients work of breathing, the amount it delivers is proportional to the percentage of assistance it is set to give.\nadaptive support ventilation is a positive pressure mode of mechanical ventilation that is closed-loop controlled. in this mode, the frequency and tidal volume of breaths of a patient on the ventilator are automatically adjusted based on the patient’s requirements. the lung mechanics data are used to adjust the depth and rate of breaths to minimize the work rate of breathing. in the asv mode, every breath is synchronized with patient effort if such an effort exists, and otherwise, full mechanical ventilation is provided to the patient.\nasv is a patented technology originally described as one of the embodiments of us patent no. 4986268. in this invention, the control algorithm computes the optimal rate of respiration to minimize the work rate of breathing. the rationale is to make the patient's breathing pattern comfortable and natural within safe limits, and thereby stimulate spontaneous breathing and reduce the weaning time."]], "context": ["小博，我最近遇到很多不认识的概念？", "概念不认识我可以教给你啊", "你知道mandatory minute volume ventilation是什么意思嘛？",
